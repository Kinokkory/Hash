# Hash Programming Language

Hash is "a much better C++".
The syntax looks like C++, but it's much more beautiful.
Hash generates a C++11 source code from the source code.

Hash was named after *Has*kell and *su*gar syntax. It also comes from C#, which can be read as C *hash*.

To know more about Hash, please see [Reference](/Reference.md).

## Basic Principle of Hash

* Beautiful Code comes from Beautiful Syntax!
* Code More Intuitively and Simply and Freely!
* No More Evil Macro & Template Techniques in C++!
* As Static as Possible!
* Make Functional Programming Easier!

## Implementation of Hash Compiler

Hash compiler is implemented in Haskell.
The syntax is parsed with a monadic packrat parser of a library "Pappy" made by Bryan Ford.
For more information about Pappy, see [here](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/).
