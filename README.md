Hash
====

Hash is an object-oriented programming language with a Haskell-like syntax.
Hash compiler generates a C++11 source code.
Hash was named after "Has"kell and sugar syntax("sh").

Features of Hash
----------------
* Syntax with off-side rule
* Algebraic Data Type
* Pattern matching
* Lazy evaluation
* Active pattern
* Units of Measure

Some features are inherited from Haskell, some from F#, and others from C++.

Type
----
Hash has no system of type inference, so you need to declare a type for each functions.
However, it can use a template type of C++.
